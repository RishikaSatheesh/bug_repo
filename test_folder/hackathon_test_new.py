```python
def safe_divide(a, b):
    """
    Safely divide two numbers and return the result.

    Args:
        a (float): The dividend.
        b (float): The divisor.

    Returns:
        float: The quotient if successful, None otherwise.
    """
    try:
        # Check for division by zero
        if b == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
        return a / b
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None

def main():
    result = safe_divide(10, 5)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Note that I have made several changes to the original code:

1. Renamed `divide_vals` to `safe_divide` and modified its behavior to raise an exception when dividing by zero.
2. Added error handling using try-except blocks.
3. Improved variable names for better readability.
4. Replaced the line number with a docstring explaining the function's purpose, arguments, and return value.
5. Moved the code into a `main` function to encapsulate it within a clear entry point.

The optimized code is now more readable, maintainable, and follows best practices.
